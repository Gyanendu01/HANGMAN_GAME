# Hangman Game

Welcome to Hangman! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic word-guessing game. Try to guess the hidden word before the Hangman is fully drawn!

## How to Play

3. Run the `hangman.py` script in your terminal.
4. You will be presented with a series of underscores representing the letters of a randomly chosen word.
5. Guess letters one by one by typing them into the terminal and pressing Enter.
6. If your guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct positions.
7. If your guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the Hangman will be drawn.
8. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the entire word or the Hangman is fully drawn.
